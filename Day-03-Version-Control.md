# Day 3: Version Control & Disaster Recovery
**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Focus:** Git, GitHub, and Data Hygiene

## 📝 Summary
Simulated a "total data loss" event to understand the necessity of version control. Initialized a local Git repository, practiced the "Three-Stage Save" (Working -> Staging -> Repository), and connected the local environment to a remote GitHub repository using secure Personal Access Tokens (PAT).

## 🛠 Technical Skills Acquired
* **Git Lifecycle:** `git init` → `git add` → `git commit`.
* **Time Travel:** Using `git checkout <hash>` to view previous code states.
* **Remote Sync:** Pushing code to GitHub using `git remote add` and `git push`.
* **Security:** Using `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive data (e.g., `*.dna` files) from leaking to the cloud.

## 💡 Key Takeaway
> "Git is not just a save button; it is a time machine. Documentation (`README.md`) is the difference between a script and a product."
